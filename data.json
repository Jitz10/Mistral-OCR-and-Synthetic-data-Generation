  "about_sector": {
    "description": "The Transmission & Distribution (T&D) sector in India is poised for significant growth, with the Total Addressable Market (TAM) projected to expand from ₹60,000 Cr to ₹3,60,000 Cr, driven by the National Electricity Plan (₹10 Lakh Cr by 2032) and the integration of 500 GW of renewable energy by 2032. Government initiatives, a $111 billion USD transmission CapEx by FY35, and rising data center demand (tripling by FY32) fuel this growth. Global demand, aging U.S. infrastructure, and African grid expansions further enhance opportunities for T&D players like Hitachi Energy."
